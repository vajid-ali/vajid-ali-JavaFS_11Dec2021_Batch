3. Example of Pre increment operator: ++a
   Example of Post increment operator: a++
   Example of Pre decrement operator: --a
   Example of Post decrement operator: a--

5. String : String is a sequence of characters. But in java string is an object that represents sequence of character.
. 

6. String name1 = "hello";
   String name2 = "hello";
   above two strings are equal. First name1 hello is store in memory location. When name2 hello is assigned and try to stored in memory 
   location then with the help of string pool both strings are store in same location because both strings are same. But if String name2 is
   declear as new string("hello") then it will store in different location because it is declear as new string.New string will take space in 
   heap memory.
    
8. In terms of speed, Java is faster than Python as it is a compiled language. It takes less time to execute a code.
   Python is an interpreted language and it determines the type of data at run time which makes it slower comparatively.
